# STX HODL Guild

A decentralized governance experiment on **Stacks (Bitcoin L2)** that prioritizes time-based conviction over pure wealth.

## The "X-Factor"
Most DAOs are dominated by "Whales" who buy tokens and immediately vote. **HODL Guild** changes this. Your voting power grows for every Bitcoin block that passes since you joined. 100 STX held for 1 year is more powerful than 1,000 STX held for 1 day.

## Tech Implementation
- **Smart Contract**: Written in `Clarity 2.0`. It uses the `block-height` global variable to ensure 100% on-chain transparency.
- **Wallet Connection**: Powered by **Reown AppKit**
- **Network**: Stacks Mainnet

## Getting Started
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
